      <h1>Josue's Portfolio</h1>
      <p>
          Hello, my name is Josue and I'm a Software Engineer at Google. I don't know how to write HTML,CSS, and JS well so this is my humble portfolio.

      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
          Originally from Venezuela, I came to the US in 1997 when I was 2 years old. 
          Except for a few months in California it's all been in the state of Washington. 
          In 2012 I graduated from high school and began my studies at the University of Washington in Seattle.
          In 2016 I graduated with a bachelor's in Computer Engineering and then
          completed a Master's in 2018 in Computer Science and Engineering.
          Shortly after graduating I started working at Google as a software engineer in Seattle.
